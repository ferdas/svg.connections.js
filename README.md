# svg.connections.js

Yet another plugin for the [svg.js](http://github.com/wout/svg.js) library to make elements connectable!

### Why another one?

- I wanted to follow the SVG.js [coding style](http://documentup.com/wout/svg.js#contributing)
- I find some lacks in other similar libraries
- I need something that allows me to create new connections by dragging and dropping

### Why not just forking?

Because... read above.

## TODOs
I'll adapt this project to be used with Grunt and other cool software. I swear, I'll do it!

## Credits
This project if freely inspired by [svg.draggable.js](https://github.com/wout/svg.draggable.js).
Thanks to the [svg.js](http://svgjs.com) community for making such a nice product.
